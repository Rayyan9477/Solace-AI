## 4. Identified Gaps

### 4.1 Priority 1: Clinical Validation **CRITICAL**

**Current State**: No published RCT evidence

**Industry Standard**:
- Woebot: 20+ RCTs published in peer-reviewed journals
- Wysa: Multiple clinical studies supporting FDA breakthrough designation
- FDA: Requires well-designed clinical trials for mental health AI devices

**Gap Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Cannot pursue FDA clearance or enterprise sales without clinical validation

**Required Actions**:
1. Design prospective RCT with control group (waitlist or active control)
2. Target: 200-400 participants across depression and anxiety conditions
3. Primary outcomes: PHQ-9 change, GAD-7 change, treatment adherence
4. Secondary outcomes: User satisfaction, engagement metrics, safety events
5. Timeline: 12-18 months for study completion
6. Resources: Clinical partnership, IRB approval, statistician

**Success Criteria**:
- Statistically significant symptom reduction vs. control
- Publication in peer-reviewed journal (JMIR Mental Health, npj Digital Medicine)
- Non-inferiority or superiority to existing digital interventions
