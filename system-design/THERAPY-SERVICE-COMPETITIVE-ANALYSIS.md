2. Target: 200-400 participants across depression and anxiety conditions
3. Primary outcomes: PHQ-9 change, GAD-7 change, treatment adherence
4. Secondary outcomes: User satisfaction, engagement metrics, safety events
5. Timeline: 12-18 months for study completion
6. Resources: Clinical partnership, IRB approval, statistician

**Success Criteria**:
- Statistically significant symptom reduction vs. control
- Publication in peer-reviewed journal (JMIR Mental Health, npj Digital Medicine)
- Non-inferiority or superiority to existing digital interventions
