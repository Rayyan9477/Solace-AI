i reviewed the codebase and find out few major flaws in it, like the codebase contains a lot pass statements abstract functions and incomplete implementation of functions
there are no standard conventions followed and no standard coding standards followed, additionally the codebase is full of mock implementation that just acts as placeholders 
and no value to the codebase please work on this 
first identify then create a plan then start acting on it

the database contains no proper structure ; D:\Repo\Contextual-Chatbot\src\solace_infrastructure all the database and structure is soo scattered and fragmented ; no proper structure for connection , also a lot of files contains multiple schemas and data records, there is no concise and precise structure; everything is soo scattered and hard to maintain or modify make sure to use centralized structure for it make sure to align it all it one ; so that we keep all the data in scalable and manageable format with all required security measures and metrics. all see the internal queries and structure.

also in the D:\Repo\Contextual-Chatbot\src\solace_ml i specially instructed to use portkey library to inference the ai models from multiple providers work on this and make it better and use it instead of manually creating integrations ; also is there an option to auto adjust parameters like temperature, top_p, top_k and others like repeat penality.

like the D:\Repo\Contextual-Chatbot\src\solace_security contains no proper structure of auth; neither at rest or at transit; the authorization and security format process are too loosely implemented and in placed. 


D:\Repo\Contextual-Chatbot\src\solace_testing very loosly implemented and too very useful and unable to cover bugs and issues
