Enhanced Diagnosis Module

This module extends the integrated diagnosis approach with advanced techniques:
1. Vector similarity for more accurate pattern matching
2. Multi-modal integration with weighted confidence scores
3. Real-time research integration for up-to-date clinical insights
4. Temporal analysis of symptom progression
5. Personalized recommendation engine

The goal is to provide a more nuanced and accurate assessment while maintaining
the focus on supporting but not replacing professional clinical evaluation.
